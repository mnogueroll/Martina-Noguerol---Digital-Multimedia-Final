<p>I created this project using several video clips I recorded during a short trip to Rijeka. I combined various techniques we had learned in classâ€”for example, at the beginning of the video, I used frame manipulation to freeze the foreground image while allowing the background to keep moving. For the rest of the video, I focused on smoother transitions synced with the background music, and experimented with different ways of incorporating text.</p>
